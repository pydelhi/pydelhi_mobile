Getting the best possible performance out of deep learning models\\nhowever, can take some work. While having more data to train the network on is\\nalways beneficial, carefully chosen model architectures and hyperparameters\\ncan yield faster and better convergence.\\n\\nThis workshop will be a tour of the important techniques that can be used to\\nget the best results from your deep learning models. The models will be\\nconstructed using Tensorflow and make use of Python 3.6. (Keras may also be\\nused to speed things up if suitable)\\n\\nWe will review a broad list of topics in the workshop, including:\\n\\n  * Weight initialization strategies\\n  * Batch Normalization\\n  * Dropout\\n  * Choice of optimizers\\n  * A discussion of activation functions\\n  * Optimizer hyperparameters\\n  * Model hyperparameters\\n  * Model architectures for specific tasks (CNNs, RNNs, GANs etc.)\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites:**\\n\\nBasic familiarity with neural networks will be a necessary prerequisite for\\nthe workshop. We will also be visualising model learning curves so previous\\ndata analysis/visualisation experience in python would be beneficial.\\n\\nIdeally, someone who is attending the workshop will have worked with neural\\nnetworks before and understands backpropagation and gradient descent.

What are its utilities?\\n\\nThough most of the people use [Mikolov et al's\\nWord2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) as a blackbox and train by:\\n\\n    \\n    \\n    import gensim\\n    sentences = [['content', 'of', 'first', 'sentence'], ['content', 'of', 'second', 'sentence'], ... , ['content', 'of', 'nth', 'sentence']]\\n    model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sentences)\\n    \\n\\nAnd never know what is cooking inside the hood. This talk would cover a very\\nbasic implementation of Word2Vec, a small tutorial of how to use Gensim to\\ntrain your own word vectors.

			"description": "\\n\\n#### **Description:**\\n\\nHumans have great ability to generalize; we can very efficiently apply the\\nknowledge we learned in classrooms to real world problems. **Transfer\\nlearning** provides a similar capability to artificial neural networks. The\\nWorkshop will introduce the concept of 'Transfer Learning' described by Andrew\\nNg, the leading expert in Machine Learning as the \" **next driver of ML\\ncommercial success.** \" Transfer Learning is important because training deep\\nneural networks from scratch have two key requirements. First, we need a large\\nlabeled dataset; the second one requires computationally efficient hardware\\n(GPUs). While such immensely large data exists for some tasks and domains, in\\nmost cases the data are usually proprietary or expensive. Transfer Learning,\\nthe technique to use models pre-trained on one domain for another problem\\ndomain, provides the ability to use DNNs even when the dataset is small.\\nMoreover, Transfer learning requires less computation and thus can be done in\\nrespectable time using CPUs as well.\\n\\nThe workshop will cover following topics:\\n\\n  * Introduction to Transfer Learning \\n  * Application of Transfer Learning\\n  * Transfer Learning Scenarios \\n  * Applying Transfer using Keras and Tensorflow\\n\\nAnd finally, we will have hands on session demonstrating how to use Xception\\nand Inception networks for Dog breed Recognition.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites:**\\n\\n  * Anaconda installed (Python =3.5)\\n  * Tensorflow 1.x\\n  * Numpy\\n  * Matplotlib\\n  * Pandas\\n  * Seaborn\\n  * For the sake of convenience and due to limited time, Speaker, will also provide environment 'yml' files (Windows10, Ubuntu14.04/16.04, Mac OS X)\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Content URLs:**\\n\\nTo make best use of the workshop it would be appreciated if participants are\\nwell versed with Anaconda, Python and understand Convolution Neural Networks.\\nThe information necessary can be accessed via following links\\n\\n  * How to manage Anaconda Environments: <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>\\n  * Convolutional Neural Networks [here](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner%27s-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/) and [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-Conv-Nets-Modular/)\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Speaker Info:**\\n\\n**Amita Kapoor** : Amita Kapoor is Associate Professor in the Department of\\nElectronics, SRCASW, University of Delhi.

			"description": "\\n\\n#### **Description:**\\n\\nMaintaining a high level of code quality is important for any serious project.\\nOne aspect of this is ensuring that all code is actually used. There are many\\nreasons for dead code ending up in a project. The most common is refactoring,\\nbut another is misspellings, which are only detected at runtime for dynamic\\nlanguages. Finding and removing dead code allows to keep the code base clean\\nand reduces bugs.\\n\\nThis talk is focussed on how we can use Vulture to find dead code. It helps\\nyou find unused code in Python programs and it is useful for cleaning up and\\nfinding errors in large code bases. If you run Vulture on both your library\\nand test suite you can find untested code. Due to Python's dynamic nature,\\nstatic code analyzers like Vulture are likely to miss some dead code. Also,\\ncode that is only called implicitly may be reported as unused. Nonetheless,\\nVulture can be a very helpful tool for higher code quality.\\n\\nOne part of this talk is to discuss how to automate testing for dead code with\\nVulture. There are quite a few options available:\\n\\n  * Adding vulture to your continuous integration testing.\\n  * A script using the Vulture API for custom tests.\\n  * [VultureBear](https://github.com/coala/coala-bears/blob/master/bears/python/VultureBear.py): Integration with [coala](https://coala.io) \\- a static code analysis tool.\\n  * Integration with automatic analysis tools like [GitMate](https://gitmate.io), etc. for automatic code-reviews with native support for Github and Gitlab.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites:**\\n\\n  * python (any version would do)\\n  * pip\\n\\nHaving coala installed will be a plus.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Content URLs:**\\n\\n  * [vulture](https://github.com/jendrikseipp/vulture)\\n\\n  * [coala.io](https://coala.io)\\n\\n  * [GitMate](https://gitmate.io)\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Speaker Info:**\\n\\n**Rahul Jha**\\n\\nHe is currently pursuing B.Tech.

			"title": "How to Boost your Tensorflow model inference performance using  Asyncio.",
			"description": "\\n\\n#### **Description:**\\n\\nLately, there has been a lot of interest in Deep Learning(dl) and thanks to\\nframeworks like tensorflow anyone can implement dl-papers and create models.\\nBut unfortunately, the deployment patterns followed are mostly rudimentary\\nREST calls to the model or using tensorflow-serving, which is fine when you\\nare experimenting but when the model gets deployed and the requests start\\nflying, such methods will create a bottleneck in your Architecture. There are\\nobvious workarounds like running multiple model instances behind a load\\nbalancer, but what if there is a much better Pythonic way.\\n\\n**Actor and CSP patterns** have been around since the 70s(73 and 78\\nrespectively) but only a niche group has taken a keen look at them and since\\nthe introduction of asyncio from Python3.5 onwards, the Python ecosystem has\\nbeen opened up to these patterns in some _limited but useful forms_. **This\\ntalk will show these patterns and how they can be used to deploy Deep Learning\\nmodels in the right way** , ( _the reference to Deep Learning alone has been\\nintentional and relates to the[batching in\\ntensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/serving_advanced)_ ). As to the\\nquestion of the credibility of these patterns, **Actor model is used by Erlang\\nand CSP model is used by Go** , yep we can write Python3 code like these\\nlanguages.\\n\\nThis talk is not about.\\n\\n  * **Microservices** , are good but you cannot have 1000's if not tens of thousands unique Microservices created on the fly, connected uniquely for each user.(A unique pipeline per user). Also, microservices have the downside of depending on an external message passing solutions(Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ) which add to the latency. \\n  * **Deep Learning algorithms** , as there are plenty of resources for the same, we are only looking at the model deployment perspective i.e. inference time optimization.\\n\\n**The proposed method is implemented using Python alone without any external\\ndependencies including 3rd party message passing solutions making it faster\\nand lighter than microservices.**\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites:**\\n\\nA basic idea of asyncio coroutines and if possible streams.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Speaker Info:**\\n\\nI started using Python in 2014 to quickly hack together my master's thesis and\\nits been a steady relationship since then. Over the past few years, I have\\nbeen working on building scalable systems and deploying Data processing\\npipelines at scale.\\n\\nLately, I have been a part of a startup that offers Chatbot services and we\\nwere facing serious scale up issues, it was while solving these issues that I\\npicked up on the ideas for this talk. If you think of Chatbots, each\\nconversation is a unique data pipeline with each node depending on different\\nentities and topics and having its own states, these are difficult to model\\nusing prevalent graph traversal techniques in Python, thus the Actor/CSP model\\nwith asyncio.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Speaker Links:**\\n\\n  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/derrick-joseph-545566a4/)\\n\\n",

Things break, daemons die, services stop, clusters fall \u2013 not to mention\\nwriting the root cause analysis (RCA) documents and runbooks on how to fix the\\nsame problem in the future. If you keep on adding monitoring, you end up\\nhaving a huge pile of alerts and failures every day.\\n\\nTo ensure availability of product as you scale, either you automate or you\\ndie. This is where Auto- Remediation comes into picture.\\n\\nAuto-Remediation, or Self-Healing, is a workflow which triggers and responds\\nto alerts or events by executing actions that can prevent or fix the problem.\\n\\nThe simplest example of auto-remediation is restarting a service (let\u2019s say\\napache) when it\u2019s down. Imagine an automated action that is triggered by a\\nmonitoring system to restart the service and prevent the application outage.\\nIn addition, it creates a task and sends a notification so that the engineer\\ncan find the root cause during business hours, and there is no need to do it\\nin the middle of the night. Furthermore, the event-driven automation can be\\nused for assisted troubleshooting, so when you get an alert it includes\\nrelated logs, monitoring metrics/graphs, and so on.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites:**\\n\\n  1.

We will be able to tell apart false IPs on HTTPS, but we are totally helpless while getting the correct IPs or safeguarding the services that do not implement SSL.\\n  * The solution lies by querying the DNS inside our own network, where we are sure of not being [MitM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack)'d.\\n\\nTo approach the above, we will be running a DNS Server on our system, and\\nsourcing the replies not by the conventional way of upstreaming it via port\\n53, but by fetching the DNS information via HTTPS using Google's DNS APIs.\\n\\nIn the attached repo, I have implemented a simple DNS Server written using\\nTwisted.

			"title": "Django on Steroids -- Building Applications at Web Scale",
			"description": "\\n\\n#### **Description:**\\n\\nDjango is an excellent web-application framework to build scalable, extensible\\nand high-performance web applications that can serve hundreds of thousands of\\nrequests per second -- while keeping the development cycle optimal and\\nmaintaining the sanity of developer mind-space. The success of the framework\\ncan be attributed to the well-thought out design patterns and opinionated\\ndecisions the framework makes that walks the thin line between having all\\nbatteries included and giving the developer tremendous room to grow out of the\\nbox.\\n\\nThis talk summarizes my learning from using Django as the core application\\nengine in multiple production applications for the past two years at DoSelect\\nto serve tens of millions of requests everyday, while maintaining stringent\\navailability SLAs and extremely low response times. The content of the talk\\noutlines the best practices and gotchas in using Django meant for web scale --\\nright from designing the project layouts to writing different components of\\nyour app, and finally breaking out of Django and using the best tools to\\nsupport performance and reliability of your application.\\n\\nThe talk would be structured around the following focus areas:\\n\\n  1. Structuring your Django project for extensibility and performance\\n  2. Designing your request-response workflow for optimal throughput\\n  3. How to write Django queries that don't kill your application\\n  4. Designing your caching workflow\\n  5. Using components around your Django app optimally -- Gunicorn, NGINX, PostgreSQL, etc.\\n\\nThe talk will include real-world code examples while illustrating the points\\nabove \u2013 explaining what I faced in production, and how I solved it (and then\\nrealized that\u2019s what I should have done in the first place). This talk builds\\non top of a talk given by me at [PyCon Pune\\n2017](https://pyconpune.talkfunnel.com/2017/63-django-on-steroids-lessons-\\nfrom-scale) \\-- the content has evolved as I have while continuing on quest to\\nuse Django better in production.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites:**\\n\\nThe talk is intended for people who have a basic knowledge of Python / Django,\\nknow how web applications work in general. Key take-aways would be things you\\ncan directly drop into your production Django application for better\\nperformance.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Content URLs:**\\n\\n  1.

			"title": "OLMONK : Data validation package",
			"description": "\\n\\n#### **Description:**\\n\\nThe cycle of data analysis involves many stages from data gathering to data\\nvisualization, with data filtering being one of the limiting steps. The need\\nfor data filtering will arise from problems in the way the data is entered and\\nstored. Mistakes as simple as setting a numeric column to character data type,\\nor passing null values to required parameters can result in crashes or\\nundefined behavior. OLMONK helps one avoid them, and enables smooth data\\nanalysis and visualization.\\n\\nThe package can be used as a validation layer before any kind of data analysis\\nsoftware. While building a software, the developer can import OLMONK and can\\ndefine constraints depending on the required input format. The package then\\nlogs appropriate warnings and errors, along with data location (i.e. row and\\ncolumn info), in a file, and notifies the user of the same. While most of the\\nstandard inconsistencies can be rectified by OLMONK, some cases may require\\nhuman intervention and for them the package raises errors.\\n\\nIt allows the user to ensure the correctness of data, before feeding the\\nanalysis tool with potentially incompatible data. One can validate different\\nkinds of data with tailor-made checks. It can currently process .csv, .txt,\\n.xlsx, .bed format files.\\n\\nOLMONK enables the user to:\\n\\n  1. Validate data with single config file \\n  2. Add external validation functions\\n  3. Generate report In different formats\\n  4. Use inbuilt data validation checks such as a check for subset, superset or duplicates\\n\\nThe code follows PEP8 and PEP256 guidelines throughout, and has been tested\\nwith >90% test coverage.\\n\\nThe talk will be focused on how to use the package for validating demo files\\nand discuss scope of the package in various industries.\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Prerequisites:**\\n\\nPython\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Content URLs:**\\n\\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1x1H20bti0benpSS0l5eDQ4cWM?usp=sharing\\n\\n\\n\\n#### **Speaker Info:**\\n\\nAnkur is a developer with over 4 years of experience in domain varying across\\nEmbedded Systems, Robotics, and Data Science.
