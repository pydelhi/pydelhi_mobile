				"description": "I will be talking about Global-Interpreter-Lock (GIL) in Python. It's a mutex that prevents multiple native threads from running in parallel. In essence, this says that a python program cannot do more than one thing at once via threading.There is lot of misconception in majority of Python Programmers regarding Global Interpreter Lock. Most of them think its the worst part of Python. I will try to demonstrate how it actually works and how we can leverage multiple CPU cores for multithreading for I/O and CPU Bound task using C-Extensions. I will also show some comparisons with different implementations of Python and the presence or absence of GIL in those, to answer questions like, why we can't just remove it from CPython and solve all our problems or why Jython performs better in Multithreading for CPU Bound task.",

				"title": "Concurrency in Python 3.0 world - Oh My!",
				"description": "In Python 3.0, concurrent programming takes many forms. One can go with traditional threads using the threading module or perform process based parallelism using the multiprocessing module. However Python 3.x also comes with concurrent futures a way to parallelize your code using multiple threads or processes and receive the results in a future object - combining parallel processing with asynchronous execution - Pretty elegant! Wait - there is also the asyncio module with its support for Asynchronous execution - for executing tasks truly asynchronously but with zero parallelism. It is an exciting way of execution typically in one thread but covering multiple tasks bit by bit - in a truly concurrent fashion. This module introduces new ways of creating co-routines using the exciting async and await keywords. The talk will also explore a few libraries outside core Python - especially we will look at an example of parallelizing execution of a Fractal generation program using multiple cores using PyMP - which is inspired by OpenMP. We will also briefly explore asynchronous programming with Twisted and also look at some examples using Gevent/Eventlet towards end of the workshop. The aim of the workshop is to introduce concurrency and parallel programming to it via Python 3.x. We will be touching upon the basics such as GIL, concurrency vs parallelism etc with real world examples and analogies, so even if you are new to the entire topic, the workshop should suit you.",

The participants would also be able to port this system to a Raspberry Pi which would allow them to voice control their other devices such as a robot, drone or coffee machine.The outcomes would be lots of people who would have acquired the knowledge of building a sophisticated Jarvis like system.

One believes in shared memory and embraces all the complexities that come bundled with it like mutexes, locks and inter-process communication. The other believes in message passing meaning that threads/processes interact explicitly by sending messages and do not share state. The speaker firmly believes in the message passing school because of its simplicity over shared memory and intends to convert every person in the room through this talk. ZeroMQ allows you to write concise and easy to understand multi threaded code that simulates the message passing model. Your threads dont share state, they communicate only by passing messages. This allows you to later split your threads into separate processes as your application needs evolve.",

Bayesian statistics is the mathematically optimal way to change one’s opinions in response to new data. In this talk I’ll provide a pythonic, rather than mathematical, introduction to Bayesian statistics. The target audience is programmers, not data scientists. I’ll show how a numpy array can be used to represent our opinion about the world. I’ll then show how we can use Bayesian statistics to change our opinion when we gain new information.
